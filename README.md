# GraphicalGuidelines

It is possible to perform detailed analysis of adherence to clinical guidelines with graphical techniques. 
We have provided demonstrations of this concept. 

Two examples are enclosed.  See the files: "Example1.sql" and "Example2.sql".  The first example can be performed in SQL.  The second example requires both SQL and c#.  

We will upload a copy of the manuscript once it passes peer-review.  These examples can be found in the supplementary material to the manuscript.  

## Getting Started

Simply download the project and run the SQL code.  This project requires SQL with a server instance to be available. Visualization of the output file will require Gephi to be installed. Gephi can be obtained from here (https://gephi.org/). 

## Built With

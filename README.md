# GraphicalGuidelines

It is possible to perform detailed analysis of adherence to clinical guidelines with graphical techniques. 
We have provided demonstrations of this concept. 

The first example creates the output table for a simple directed graph, which can then be loaded into graphical modeling software such as Gephi. In the first example, four nodes (start, 1, 2, and end) and three edges (start --> 1, 1 --> 2, and 2 --> end) are generated. Loading the output file into Gephi will allow for visualization of this simple model. 



## Getting Started

Simply download the project and run the SQL code.  This project requires SQL with a server instance to be available. Visualization of the output file will require Gephi to be installed. Gephi can be obtained from here (https://gephi.org/).
